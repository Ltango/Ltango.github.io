		&emsp;In software engineering it is very common to find developers reusing modules of code from prior projects.  Entire libraries are released on public repositories aimed at reducing the amount of time and effort required for developers to finish their projects.  Because of the nature of work in software it is easy to see how an ethical dilemma arises from the vast differences in work required based on reuse of old work.
		</p>
		<p>
		&emsp;Many software engineering students in college are faced with similar problems to solve through their classes.  There are many times where it makes sense to take previous work and modify it to complete assignments.  This creates an interesting ethical situation where you may be doing less work than your peers for solving the same problem.  However the work has already been done by the student and it also does not make sense to waste time for the sake of wasting time.
		</p>
		<p>
		&emsp;In the professional realm of a realistic work environment there are other ethical dilemmas that come from reusing your own code.  One example would be an IT security employee who is responsible for automating security processes.  One new aspect here is that the employee is being paid for his development time.  A second aspect is that the code for automation is being developed and stored on computers owned by the business.  A third aspect is the code itself and the solution that the employee decided to solve their automation problem.  If the employee moves to another competing company, they may want to use the same automation solution that they made for the old company.  However it can be argued that because the developer was paid by the first company and the code was developed and stored on those computers that the developer has no right to directly implement that new solution to the new company.  In addition exposing potential security holes between different companies would be highly unethical.
		</p>
		<p>
		&emsp;Developing privately outside of commercial settings would be the most ideally acceptable time to take old code and apply it directly to a new project.  When money is brought into the equation it escalates the magnitude of ethical dilemmas.
