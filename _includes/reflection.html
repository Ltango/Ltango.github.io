			    Iowa state has presented several experiences in the form of challenges, rewards, and opportunities.  When I first entered the college of engineering I was an Aerospace Engineering student.  During this time I took the difficult core engineering math, physics, and chemistry classes.  I was also introduced to my first major groupwork, designing rotor-wing aircraft capable of navigating an obstacle course.  From this groundwork I transitioned into software engineering.  Throughout the software engineering curriculum there have been several group and individual development projects that have challenged my way of thinking.  Through these challenges I have developed as a better academic, member of the workforce, and ethical citizen of society.
My time at Iowa state has prepared me specifically as an engineer to enter to workforce as an effective contributor and leader.  Through software design and architecture classes I have learned optimal ways to design, build, maintain, and retire large and small scale projects.  I have learned many ways to solve complex mathematical and conceptual problems in creative and logical ways.  It has taught me a way of thinking, rather than plugging in numbers to equations for every problem.  From these collegiate level skills I have evolved further through jobs and internships.  Specifically as a supervisor I have developed major leadership and management skills, and as a IT security intern I have developed specialized automation and security skills that have been directly applied to the commercial sector.  It has also challenged me to abide by engineering ethics in the workplace, I have had to make decisions that abide by ethics I have been taught at Iowa State even though it makes development more time consuming.
	Iowa State Software Engineering has exposed me to a variety of different kinds of people, and I have learned have to cooperate and work with them through different development group projects.  This has translated directly to working with groups in the job field when developing specific applications.  These professional responsibilities impose a great deal of challenge and accomplishment after nearly completing the curriculum at Iowa State.
	Iowa State has forced me to utilize different sources of information to learn more than the material I have been lectured and presented with.  Many specific online library sources, open-source software, and electronic publishings have given me deeper understanding of  software, security, and algorithm technology and practices in the real world.  I have taken full advantage of the electronic and internet resources available to me as a student of software engineering.   I have also had mentorship help from old and new coworkers exposing me to new solutions and technologies.
	Outside of Iowa state I have gained experience attending events such as hackathon to help further my development in a different setting.  These event are often much more entertaining and exposing to different levels up expertise for the student population.  I have taken my own personal education further by trying to obtain an OSCP (Offensive Security Certified Professional) certification, starting with the eJPT (Junior Penetration Tester) classes.  I hope to take and develop these skills further to advance into a career into cybersecurity and potentially penetration testing.  
	The biggest change I would make in my undergraduate time would be to start with Software Engineering rather than spend so much time taking Aerospace courses.  This has delayed my graduation by a couple of years while giving me minor certification benefits.  Because of the difficulty of the classes involved in the Aerospace Engineering curriculum my GPA is also not as high as it would be if I wouldâ€™ve just taken software engineering classes.  That being the only thing I would change I still enjoyed my academic mission through what Iowa State has offered to me.
